The Plan This Week So far, I’ve confirmed that the president’s party often performs poorly in the midterm House elections and that a combination of fundamental (Q8, national) economic variables, including GDP growth %, RDI change %, unemployment rate, and absolute GDP growth, are somewhat able to predict House incumbent party vote share.

            This is blog post #2 in a series of analytical posts in lieu of the 2022 midterms. This post is affiliated with Gov 1347: Election Analytics, a course at Harvard University in the department of Government.
Last week, my dive into the 2018 election results and swings confirmed that the president’s party often performs poorly in the midterms. By the 2020 House elections, the president’s party gained some of its vote share back.

            This is blog post #1 in a series of analytical posts in lieu of the 2022 midterms. This post is affiliated with Gov 1347: Election Analytics, a course at Harvard University in the department of Government.
Over the next several weeks, I will be exploring previous U.S. elections data to analyze voter trends and behavior. This exploration will aide in my ultimate goal of forecasting the 2022 midterm election results.
